      This is my first paragraph. I'm not really sure why it's behaving
      this way, but I think the last thing was just some sort of coincidence.
      In any case, this formatting should allow me to write paragraphs. To be
      honest, I'm just trying to figure out what all the stuff at the 
      beginning is supposed to be. I mean, it's not too hard to guess, for 
      some of it. Pretty sure I don't need a PhD to figure out what "color"
      does. Still, gotta fsck around with the padding and margin stuff.

      Can you see this change?
